In this article, we will show you how to design a simple PCB with CadSoft Eagle Professional 6.5.0 in a few steps.
 
## Step 1: Create a New Project and Schematic
 
To start designing your PCB, you need to create a new project and schematic in Eagle. To do this, open the software and click on *File > New > Project*. Give your project a name and save it in a folder of your choice.
 
Next, click on *File > New > Schematic* to open a blank schematic window. Here you can add components, wires, labels, and other elements to your circuit design.
 
## Step 2: Add Components and Connect Them
 
To add components to your schematic, click on the *Add* button on the left toolbar or press *F4*. A window will pop up with a list of libraries that contain various components. You can browse through the libraries or use the search function to find the component you need.
 
For example, if you want to add a resistor, you can type "resistor" in the search box and select the one you want from the results. Then click *OK* and place the component on your schematic by clicking on the desired location.
 
To connect components, click on the *Net* button on the left toolbar or press *F3*. Then click on the pins of the components you want to connect and drag a wire between them. You can also use the *Junction* button or press *F6* to create junctions where wires cross.
 
## Step 3: Assign Values and Names to Components
 
To assign values and names to your components, double-click on them and enter the desired information in the dialog box that appears. For example, if you want to assign a value of 10k ohms to a resistor, double-click on it and type "10k" in the value field.
 
You can also use the *Name* button on the left toolbar or press *F2* to give your components unique names that will help you identify them later. For example, you can name your resistor "R1".
 
## Step 4: Check for Errors and Generate a Netlist
 
To check for errors in your schematic, click on the *ERC* button on the top toolbar or press *F7*. This will run an electrical rule check that will detect any potential problems with your circuit design, such as missing connections, short circuits, or incompatible components.
 
If there are any errors, they will be displayed in a window at the bottom of your screen. You can click on each error to see its details and location on your schematic. You can also use the *Show* button or press *F9* to highlight the error on your schematic.
 
To fix an error, you can either edit your schematic or ignore it if it is not critical. To ignore an error, right-click on it and select *Approve*.
 
Once you have fixed or approved all errors, you can generate a netlist for your circuit. A netlist is a file that contains information about the components and connections in your circuit. It is used by the PCB layout software to create your PCB design.
 
To generate a netlist, click on the *Netlist* button on the top toolbar or press *F8*. A window will pop up where you can choose the format and name of your netlist file. Click *Create* to
